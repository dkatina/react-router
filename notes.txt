---------- Ways to navigate using provided React Router DOM tools ----------------

Link - Prevents a full page reload (unlike anchor tags), and will render the page you wish to navigate too.

NavLink - Does the same think that link does, but NavLink knows which route is currently active, with a isActive prop

useNavigate - useNavigate is a hook in react that can be called in functions to navigate after particular logic is ran.
